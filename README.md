# IceBreaker

IceBreaker is an Android application that allows recruiters/hiring manaagers to post open positions and allow job seekers to easily apply to said postions. This version of the application depicts a prototype of the application and a glimpse at the features that would show in later releases.

## Getting Started

There are two ways to install the application:
- If you have an Android device, you can install the APK directly on to your device.
- If you have Android Studio set up on your device, you can go under the "profile or debug APK" from the Android Studio start up screen or choose that option under the "File" tab on the menu in a project.

## Operation

After opening the application, you will be met with two buttons: 
- Sign up
- Sign in
Sign up indicates that you would like to create a new profile and Sign in indicates that you would like to sign into an existing account. After signung up or signing in you will be shown a stack of profiles to swipe through. Swipe right to apply to an open position or begin talking to the shown candidate. 

## Known Issues

- Unable to create a profile of the same type after creating a profile
- Data does not persist after closing a conversation in Messaging
